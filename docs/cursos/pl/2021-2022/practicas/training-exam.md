## Parsing RegExps

* Read carefully [the pdf with the questions](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL-2122/exam-training-template/blob/master/docs/exam.pdf)
* Fill the code in this template repo [ULL-ESIT-PL-2122/exam-training-template](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL-2122/exam-training-template)

[AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/4ea2b52f0e546af6fb14f9b2f5671c1c/49dafda5429858220f62387740fd4226cdc3dde0) supports various regexp parsers. Feel free to play with them and have a look at the shapes of the ASTs.


## Other Examples

* See also another exam example in section [Translator from Egg AST to AST Term
](/practicas/tfa.html#translator-from-egg-ast-to-ast-term) of the TFA. The task there is to build a JSON Parser and translate a JSON containing the AST of an Egg parser onto the term notation.
