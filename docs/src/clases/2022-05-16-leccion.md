## TFA

* See [TFA description](/practicas/tfa.html)
  
### TFA assesment

* The delivery and evaluation of the TFA is done in the last two weeks
* In the last week the two PL teachers will attend the TFA evaluation
* In these sessions the score will be made with the same scale used in the rest of the labs
* If the TFA has been passed in the face-to-face evaluation, there will be a subsequent non-face-to-face evaluation to obtain a more precise numerical qualification.
