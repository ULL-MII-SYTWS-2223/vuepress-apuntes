# Toby Ho Course on How to Make a Parser with Nearley.JS

## Part One

In this drive by code session we’ll show you what a context-free grammar is and how to use it and Nearley to build parsers. JSON is used as the example language we’ll build the parser for.

## Part Two

In this drive by code session we continue making a JSON parser. After having make a working parser for a subset of the functionality in JSON, we’ll introduce the ability to embed JavaScript code in the grammar to customize the result of a parse. Again, Waikit wrote the code, and I’ll replay them and explain what he did. Enjoy!

## Part Three

In this drive by code session we’ll demonstrate how to handle whitespaces in a grammar using Nearley.js. The convention used in the video is based on the recommendations by Kartik Chandra - the creator of Nearley.js. As usual, Waikit drove the code before hand, and I’ll replay his code session and explain what he did.

## Part Four

In this episode we’ll demonstrate how to parse a string literal in JSON properly, continuing our series on building parsers using Nearley.js.

## Part Five

Continuing in the series on making parsers, this time, we build a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. In particular, we tackle the issue of operator precedence.
